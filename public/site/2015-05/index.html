        What's your <input type="password" value="password" size="5">?</h2>
    <p>Passwords have slowly become regarded as a "necessary evil" to having accounts online.  We accept they are they way things are done and try to adapt.<br>
    But upon reflection, we find that we've adapted quite poorly.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Sites everywhere expect us to come up with a secure and unique password for them.  We try our best to compensate for this unrealistic demand; we keep track of passwords in note books, apps, on our computers, or we simplify them so we won't forget.<br>
    <b>We've become symptomatic</b>.</p>

    <h2><img src="/img/thinking_882797.svg" title="https://thenounproject.com/term/thinking/882797/" />
        The real issue.</h2>
    <p>Humans are no good at remembering lots of passwords.  But writing them down or saving them is dangerous, too.</p>
    <p>Master Password avoids all the pitfalls: a cryptographic algorithm calculates your site's password for you, from thin air, only when you need it.<br>
    When you're done, it throws the password out of memory, so it can't be stolen.</p>
    <p>
    Master Password's unique approach makes you safer from loss, theft, problems with backups, sync, confiscation, snooping, and more.
    </p>

    <p>Let's see how Master Password could help you:
    <ul>
        <li class="item_toggler">
            <input type="checkbox" id="mp_test_1">
            <label for="mp_test_1">My passwords are pretty simple.  Certainly not very complex or cryptographically opaque.</label>
            <p class="toggle_item">
                Master Password was designed to generate high-entropy cryptographically strong and unique passwords for each of your sites.<br>
                Humans are not good at thinking of strong passwords, use the password created for your site by Master Password.  Your accounts will become as safe as they can be against hacks, hoaxes and leaks.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="item_toggler">
            <input type="checkbox" id="mp_test_2">
            <label for="mp_test_2">I use an app to store and remember my passwords for me.</label>
            <p class="toggle_item">
                Password vaults come with many caveats and render you dependant upon your app and your phone.  You could lose either, your device could be stolen or your data copied.  And how much should we really be trusting the Cloud?<br>
                Master Password operates completely off-line.  It saves no secrets on your device, meaning there's nothing to lose or copy.  Just like a store-bought calculator, you can lose it and replace it with a new one, and still get the exact same results, making you immune to loss.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="item_toggler">
            <input type="checkbox" id="mp_test_3">
            <label for="mp_test_3">I keep my passwords in the cloud, or sync them between all of my devices.</label>
            <p class="toggle_item">
                It seems like every month we hear about a new high-profile data leak or foreign hack.  How much can we really trust that our passwords are safe in the cloud?<br>
                Master Password was designed to operate entirely off-line, keeping all of your secrets close to heart.  They don't even get saved on your phone after you look them up, meaning there's nothing left to steal or confiscate.  Take back control over your own identity.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="item_toggler">
            <input type="checkbox" id="mp_test_4">
            <label for="mp_test_4">I share some of my accounts with friends or family.</label>
            <p class="toggle_item">
                Sharing passwords is a great way to give trusted people access to your accounts.  But what happens when a relationship degrades?  Especially if these passwords you shared were used for many of your accounts?<br>
                Master Password is based on the principle that each account should have its own dedicated password.  Sharing passwords is fine; if you need to rescind a password, all you need to do is increment the site's counter in Master Password and update the account with the new password we've generated for you, locking out the people you need no longer trust.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="item_toggler">
            <input type="checkbox" id="mp_test_5">
            <label for="mp_test_5">My main struggle with passwords is remembering what they are.</label>
            <p class="toggle_item">
                This is the core problem with passwords: we need to be able to remember them.<br>
                Master Password solves this by embracing the fact that it is impossible to remember passwords for sites.  Instead, remember only one password: your master password.  Use it only with your Master Password app to look up the key to use for logging into any site you like.
